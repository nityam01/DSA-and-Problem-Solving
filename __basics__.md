# Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

### Space Complexity

### What does Better mean?

- Faster
- Less memory-intensive
- More readable

### The Problem with Time

- Different machines will record different times
- Same machine will record different times
- For fast algorithms, speed measurements may not be precise enough

**Algorithm:** A process or set of rules to accomplish a certain tasks

## PROBLEM SOLVING

- **Understand the problem**

  - Can I restate the problem in my own words?
  - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
  - What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
  - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
  - How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

- **Explore concrete examples**

  - Start with simple examples
  - Progress to more complex examples
  - Explore examples with empty inputs
  - Explore examples with invalid inputs

- **Break it down**

  - Explicitly write out the steps you need to take

- **Solve/Simplify**

  - Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do

- **Look back and refactor**
